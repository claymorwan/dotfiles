## 📖 CMI-fold-menu-JS Guide:

### Overview
In version 2.1, CMI introduced JavaScript code to help users simplify the lengthy context menus. Fold infrequently used context menu items from the page context menu (contentAreaContextMenu) into a single submenu labeled "Show More Options". The goal is to declutter the context menu while preserving full access to folded item

### Key Features

- 🗂️ Fold selected menuitems (by id) into a "Show more options" submenu.

- 📄 Two configuration sources: a CSS variable (--cmi-fold-item-ids) for portable configs, or an about:config string preference (cmi-fold-item-IDs).

- 🖱️ Toggle script enable/disable with pref cmi-fold_menu_item-enable.

- ✏️ Customizable submenu label via CSS var or pref.

- 🌟 Quick-toggle hotkey: while context menu is open and pointer is hovering an item, keep the `CapsLock` key on, and `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `A` to toggle that item's folded/unfolded state (it will be added to or removed from the fold list) 🚀 This hotkey enables you to easily add menu items to the configuration without the need for you to manually copy the IDs of the menu items.

- ⌨️ Holding Shift while opening the context menu temporarily disables folding and hides the "Show more options" item to reveal the original full menu.

- Attempts to preserve moved items' visual appearance (icons/styles) by snapshotting inline styles/attributes where possible.

### Hotkey & Usage

- Toggle hovered item: Keep the `CapsLock` key on, and `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `A` when context menu open and pointer is on a menu item.

- Show full menu temporarily: hold `Shift` while opening context menu.

- Submenu items: for items with submenus, press the hotkey quickly (before the submenu expands) for best results.

### 🛠️ Configuration (For Advanced Users)

#### 1.CSS variable (portable)

  --cmi-fold-item-ids: "context-openlink, context-openlinkprivate, context-sendlinktodevice";	/* Add menu item ids */

  --cmi-fold-menu-label: "Show more options"; /*Cover the "Show more options" text (This mod has built-in localization for common languages. However, if you are not satisfied with the localization of the script, or if your language is not included in the localization, you can manually specify the displayed text here. */)
}
```  


#### 2.about:config (quick edit)

1.Create a new string pref `cmi-fold-item-IDs` and set a comma or space separated list of ids, e.g.:
```
context-openlink, context-openlinkprivate, context-sendlinktodevice
```

2. `cmi-fold-menu-label`

3.✨ `cmi-fold_tab_menu_item-enable`

Enable the function of the folding tab menu:

⚠️:

Please manually enable it through , as it may not be necessary for all users.

Please do not attempt to collapse the "share" menu item, as it has no ID and thus may cause errors.

If an error has occurred, please go to your user profile, locate the prefs.js file, search for cmi-fold-tab-item-IDs, and delete that line. Then restart your browser.
